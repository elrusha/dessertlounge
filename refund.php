As a general rule Buyer shall not be entitled to cancel Order once placed. Buyer may choose to cancel Order only within one-minute of the Order being placed. However, subject to Buyer’s previous cancellation history, Dessert Lounge reserves the right to deny any refund to Buyer pursuant to a cancellation initiated by Buyer even if the same is within one-minute followed by suspension of account, as may be necessary in the sole discretion of Swiggy. 

If Buyer cancels his/her Order after one minute of placing it, Dessert Lounge shall have a right to collect a penalty of 100% of the Order amount for breach of contract terms as a compensation for the damages suffered by Dessert lounge, with a right to either not to refund the Order value in case Buyer’s Order is prepaid or recover from the Buyer’s subsequent Order in case his/her Order is postpaid, to compensate the Merchants and PDPs.

            style="text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;font-size:12pt;">&quot;. Buyer may be entitled to a refund for prepaid Orders.  Dessert Lounge retains the right to retain the penalty payable by the Buyer in Section I(2) from the amount refundable to him/her. The Buyer shall also be entitled to a refund of proportionate value in the event packaging of an item in an Order or the complete Order, is either tampered or damaged and the Buyer refuses to accept at the time of delivery for the said reason;

Buyer may be entitled to a refund upto 100% of the Order value if PDP fails to deliver the Order due to a cause attributable to either PDP or Dessert Lounge, however such refunds will be assessed on a case to case basis by Swiggy.

Our decision on refunds shall be final and binding.
