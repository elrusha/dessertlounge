                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” So, cookies served by Dessert Lounge while you are on the dessert Lounge Platform are first party cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you are visiting are called “third party cookies.” For eg., we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit the Dessert Lounge Platform, and that would be a third party cookie.
                    Local storage is a technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your device. “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function
